      <![CDATA[https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-1000027
      Spring Framework through 5.3.16 suffers from a potential remote code execution (RCE) issue if used for Java deserialization of untrusted data. Depending on how the library is implemented within a product, this issue may or not occur, and authentication may be required. NOTE: the vendor's position is that untrusted data is not an intended use case. The product's behavior will not be changed because some users rely on deserialization of trusted data.

      Spring Framework Security issue - according to CVD (above link) this is addressed in v5.3.2 onwards, however not quite sure on why this is still being flagged against 5.7.1 version of Spring Security!

      As per Spring (Tanzu) mitigation, Spring Security 5.7+ fixes the issues so this should not be reported against our build!
